    <h2>About me</h2>
        <article id ="about"> 
            <p>My name is Christopher Joo. I am a new and uprising developer who completed the Columbia University Coding Bootcamp. Though the journey was tough, it was challenging and made me push myself to my own limits. I grew up in a small town called Huntingdon Valley in Northeast Philadelphia and graduated from Lower Moreland Highschool. I completed 3 and a half years in Pennsylvania State University. During my time there, I majored in Mechanical Engineering and wanted to pursue my time into information systems.</p>
